<p class="cursor_Help">A full stack developer has the skills and ability to complete a product independently. He or she can handle the work of front-end UI programming and development, databases, and servers. This also includes work on native application stacks, mobile stacks, or web application stacks with full stack web developer skills. So, instead of a front-end or back-end developer, you can learn the required full stack developer skills and be able to handle any aspect of app design, from front to back. Youâ€™re the Swiss Army knife of app development!</p>
